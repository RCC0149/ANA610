# ANA 610 – Data Management for Analytics

**Author:** Randall C. Crawford

This repository contains coursework completed for **ANA 610: Data Management for Analytics**, a graduate-level course focused on the **end-to-end preparation of data for analytical and machine learning projects** using SAS and R Studio.

The course emphasized that effective analytics depend on **data quality, structure, and integrity**, with hands-on work covering the full data management lifecycle from acquisition through feature readiness.

### Topics and skills developed include:

* Auditing and profiling raw datasets to assess **structure, completeness, and integrity**
* Classifying variables by **analytic data type** (categorical, numeric, date, character)
* Merging and reshaping multiple data sources into **tidy modeling datasets**
* Identifying and addressing **missing values, extreme values, and extreme distributions**
* Applying **imputation strategies** for numeric and categorical variables
* Feature engineering for **categorical, numeric, date, and character data**
* Transformations, scaling, binning, and encoding techniques
* Feature selection and **variable reduction** to mitigate dimensionality issues
* Documenting data issues and preparing **analytic-ready datasets** for downstream modeling

Assignments required applying these techniques using statistical programming tools, reinforcing disciplined data preparation practices that support **robust, reproducible analytics**.

This repository demonstrates applied competency in **data management, data cleansing, and feature engineering**, aligned with the learning objectives of ANA 610.
